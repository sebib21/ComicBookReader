# &#128212; ComicBookReader
This repository contains the source code for a multi-platform application that can be used to open and read comic books.<br/>

## Project Goals
Gaining more experience with C# and .NET 8 while using Clean Architecture and working with archive file types within the system.

## Current status
The Android version has all the basic features I wanted. However, the Desktop version lacks the ability to zoom pages and has some other issues. Development of the application is currently on hold because I have achieved all the basic goals I set out to accomplish.

## Technologies Used
Backend: C# (.NET MAUI framework)<br/>
Frontend: XAML
