# ComicBookReader (in progress)
This repository contains the source code for a multi-platform application that can be used to open and read comic books.

## Project Goals
Gaining more experience with C# and .NET 8 while using Clean Architecture. I intend to use the final product for personal purposes, but also to publish the Android or Windows version on a store.

## Technologies Used
Backend: C# (.NET MAUI framework)
Frontend: XAML
